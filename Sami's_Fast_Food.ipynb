        "###**Problem Statment:**\n",
        "#####Using dictionaries, create a program that can do the job of a cashier in a fast-food restaurant.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Expected Final Output:**\n",
        "#####The final outcome which I expect from a user who orders 3 items should look something like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### \"User here is your final order of ['Pizza', 'Onion Rings', 'Sprite',] , costing you $11.45 enjoy your day and come back again!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Logic used to solve the problem:**\n",
        "#####Using dictionaries I stored all the dishes in the same category in the same dictionary and I had an empty list in which I stored the user's order. I used the name of the dish as the key and the value of the dish as the price for that dish. I would take the user's input after I asked them which meal that they would select and then first see if they would like that meal by putting it into an if statement and seeing if their input was no. If they did order a meal the program goes through another if statement which searches to see if the user's input was in the dictionary key for that meal. If it wasn't in the dictionary keys the program ends. If the input is in the dictionary keys the program takes the user's input to see what dictionary key matches it then it gets a value of that key which is turned into a variable to save the price of what they ordered. This is repeated 4 times to get the user through all the categories of meals. Then the program adds all the prices of the meals together by adding all the price variables together. Using an if statement the program checks if the total price is equal to 0. This used to make sure that the user didn't order anything as if the user ordered something the total price would have value. If the total price is equal to 0 then the program ends, but if it has a value then the program uses an if statement to confirm that the user wants to order the meal. If the user says yes the program uses time.sleep and a for loop which prints \"...\" to pretend that the food is being cooked. Finally, the program prints the list where all the orders are saved and the total price.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Future Modifications**\n",
        "#####In the future, I will probably add an option to multiple of the same meal and multiple meals in the same category. Also, I would like to add more meals as well as have the time it takes to cook the meal change depending on how many meals the user ordered. Finally, I would like to add discounts and have the program recognized that if a certain order of foods are a discount or not.\n",
